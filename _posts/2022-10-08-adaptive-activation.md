Our immune system is one of the nature's marvelous inventions and compels us to study its intricacies. Let's zoom in on one of its details - the activation of the adaptive system.

## Innate system - the first line of defence

Whenever a _pathogen_ (aka unwanted matter) enters our ogranism, the _innate immune system_ is activated. One of its goals is to quickly remove any intruders and help withhold the _homeostatis_ - a balanced functioning of our body.

The innate system handles most of the simple intrusions but gets overwhelmed by serious adversaries such as the common flu or COVID-19. In order to overcome such encounters, it needs the help of the _adaptive immune system_.

## Gathering intel

Throughout our bodies special cells are stationed - the _Dendritic Cells_. They continuously monitor their surroundings by sampling the matter around them, searching for anomalies. Once a pathogen is found, the Dendritic Cell stops further sampling and embarks on a journey via the lymphatic vessels to the _lymph nodes_. The lymph nodes are  staging points for the adaptive system and having reached them, the dendritic cell unleashes the full might of the immune system.

How does the activation take place? Dendritic Cells are antigen-presenting cells. It means they express antigens on their surface. In the case of the Dendritic Cells, the antigens are held on small protrusions on their membrane called **MHC class II**. A model of the presentation be seen below:

After the pathogen is displayed, the Dendritic Cell stops presenting new antigens. The journey to the lymph node may take many hours and this decision ensures that the cell presents a snapshot of what's present in the infection place. Notice how it means that the adaptive system takes some time before being activated. _This is by design_ , because the adaptive system is very costly for the organism and it would be counterproductive to activate it immediately. Especially, in the scenarios where the innate system can handle the infection by itself, the adaptive system will never be informed about the intrusion.

Having reached the lymph node, the Dendritic Cell encounters representatives of the adaptive immune system - the **T Cells** .

Now, the T Cells are specific. Every cell is slightly different and able to recognize a specific pathogen. The T Cell will only recognize the pathogen it is able to effectively fight against. Therefore, the Dendritic Cell will "rub itself" against multiple T Cells until a match is found.
